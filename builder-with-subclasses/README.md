See [http://weblogs.java.net/blog/emcmanus/archive/2010/10/25/using-builder-pattern-subclasses](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/emcmanus/archive/2010/10/25/using-builder-pattern-subclasses) for the initial ideas.

My personal opinions:

* xxxV3 is propably the best variant
* xxxV4 is shorter but has some smells
* BuilderWithSubclasses uses a strange syntax but isn't too bad, too
